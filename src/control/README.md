# Chapter 5 Quest Navigation

### Exercise 1
    Write a program to print values from one to 100.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E01_To100.java)

---

### Exercise 2
    Write a program to generate 25 random int
    values. Use an if-else statement for each value
    to classify it as greater than, less than, or
    equal to a second randomly generated value.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E02_RandomInts.java)

---

### Exercise 3
    Modify Exercise 2 so your code is
    surrounded by an "infinite" while loop. It
    will then run until you interrupt it,
    typically with Control-C.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E03_RandomInts2.java)

---

### Exercise 4
    Write a program to detect and print prime numbers
    (integers evenly divisible only by themselves
    and 1), using two nested for loops and the
    modulus operator (%).
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E04_FindPrimes.java)

---

### Exercise 5
    Repeat Exercise 10 from the previous chapter,
    but use the ternary operator and a bitwise test
    instead of Integer.toBinaryString() to display
    the ones and zeroes.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E05_BitwiseOperators2.java)

---

### Exercise 6
    Modify the two test() methods in the previous
    two programs so they take two extra
    arguments, begin and end, and so testval is
    tested to see if it is within the range between
    (and including) begin and end.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E06_RangeTest.java)

---

### Exercise 7
    Modify Exercise 1 so the program exits by
    using the break keyword at value 99. Try using
    return instead.
  [Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E07_To98.java)

---

### Exercise 8
    Create a switch statement inside a for loop
    that tries each case and prints a message. Put
    a break after each case and test it, then see
    what happens when you remove the breaks.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E08_SwitchDemo.java)

---

### Exercise 9
    A Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 1,
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc., where each
    number (from the third on) is the sum of the previous
    two. Create a method that takes an integer as an
    argument and displays that many Fibonacci numbers
    starting from the beginning. If, e.g., you run java
    Fibonacci 5 (where Fibonacci is the name of the
    class) the output will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.
[Main class](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/control/E09_Fibonacci.java)

---

### Exercise 10
    A vampire number has an even number of digits and
    is formed by multiplying a pair of numbers containing
    half the number of digits of the result. The digits
    are taken from the original number in any order.
    Pairs of trailing zeroes are not allowed. Examples
    include:
    1260 = 21 * 60 
    1827 = 21 * 87
    2187 = 27 * 81 
    Write a program that finds all the 4-digit vampire numbers. (Suggested by Dan Forhan.)
