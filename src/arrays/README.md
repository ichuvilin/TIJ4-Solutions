# Chapter 16 Arrays

## Exercise 1

    Create a method that takes an array of
    BerylliumSphere as an argument. Call the method,
    creating the argument dynamically. Demonstrate
    that ordinary aggregate array initialization
    doesn’t work in this case. Discover the only
    situations where ordinary aggregate array
    initialization works, and where dynamic aggregate
    initialization is redundant.

---

### Exercise 2

    Write a method that takes an int argument and
    returns an array of that size, filled with
    BerylliumSphere objects.

[E02_ReturningArray](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/arrays/E02_ReturningArray.java)

---

### Exercise 3

    Write a method that creates and initializes a
    two-dimensional array of double. The size of
    the array is determined by the arguments of
    the method, and the initialization values are
    a range determined by beginning and ending
    values that are also arguments of the method.
    Create a second method that will print the
    array generated by the first method. In main()
    test the methods by creating and printing
    several different sizes of arrays.

## Exercise 4

    Repeat the previous exercise for a 
    three-dimensional array.

## Exercise 5

    Demonstrate that multidimensional arrays of
    non-primitive types are automatically initialized
    to null. 

[E05_NonPrimitiveMultiDArray](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/arrays/E05_NonPrimitiveMultiDArray.java)

---

## Exercise 6

    Write a method that takes two int arguments,
    indicating the two sizes of a 2-D array. The
    method should create and fill a 2-D array of
    BerylliumSphere according to the size arguments. 

[E06_Filling2DArray](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/arrays/E06_Filling2DArray.java)

## Exercise 7

    Repeat the previous exercise for a 3-D array.

[E07_Filling3DArray](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/arrays/E07_Filling3DArray.java)

---

## Exercise 8

    "Erasure gets in the way again—this example
    attempts to create arrays of types that have been
    erased, and are thus unknown types. Notice that
    you can create an array of Object, and cast it,
    but you get an “unchecked” warning at compile
    time because the array doesn’t really hold or
    dynamically check for type T. That is, if I create
    a String[], Java will enforce at both compile time
    and run time that I can only place String objects
    in that array. However, if I create an Object[],
    I can put anything except primitive types in that
    array."
    
    Demonstrate the assertions in the previous
    paragraph.

## Exercise 9

    Create the classes necessary for the Peel<Banana>
    example and show that the compiler doesn’t accept
    it. Fix the problem using an ArrayList.

## Exercise 10

    Modify ArrayOfGenerics.java to use containers
    instead of arrays. Show that you can eliminate
    the compile-time warnings.

[E10_ArrayOfGenerics2](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/arrays/E10_ArrayOfGenerics2.java)

## Exercise 11

    Show that autoboxing doesn’t work with arrays.

## Exercise 12

    Create an initialized array of double using
    CountingGenerator. Print the results.

    fill each array by using CountingGenerator.
    Print each array.

## Exercise 15

    Modify ContainerComparison.java by creating a
    Generator for BerylliumSphere, and change main()
    to use that Generator with Generated.array().

---

## Exercise 16

    Starting with CountingGenerator.java, create a
    SkipGenerator class that produces new values by
    incrementing according to a constructor argument.
    Modify TestArrayGeneration.java to show that your
    new class works correctly. 

[E16_SkipGenerator](https://github.com/ichuvilin/TIJ4-Solutions/blob/master/src/arrays/E16_SkipGenerator.java)

## Exercise 17

    Create and test a Generator for BigDecimal, and
    ensure that it works with the Generated methods.

## Exercise 19

    Create a class with an int field that’s initialized
    from a constructor argument. Create two arrays
    of these objects, using identical initialization
    values for each array, and show that Arrays.equals()
    says that they are unequal. Add an equals() method
    to your class to fix the problem.

 print(aList[4]) 
 aList.append(6) 
 aList += [7,8]
 print(aList) 
 aSlice = aList[2:4] 
 print(aSlice)
